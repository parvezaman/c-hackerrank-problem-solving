 <summary><h3>Problem 1: Hello World! in C</h3></summary>
<p>This challenge requires you to print Hello World on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout. If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.</p>
</details>
<details>
 <summary><h3>Problem 2: Sum and Difference of two numbers</h3></summary>
<p>our task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:</p>
 <P>1. Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.</P>
 <P>2. Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.</p>
 <P>3. Use the  and  operator to perform the following operations:</p>
 <P> <kbd>⇥</kbd> 3.1. Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.</p>
 <P> <kbd>⇥</kbd> 3.2. Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.</p>
</details>
<details>
 <summary><h3>Problem 3: Functions in C</h3></summary>
<p>Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary><h3>Problem 4: Pointers in C</h3></summary>
<p>Complete the function void update(int *a,int *b). It receives two integer pointers, int* a and int* b. Set the value of a to their sum, and b to their absolute difference. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd> α = (a + b)</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd> β = |a - b|</p>
</details>

 <summary><h3>Problem 5: Conditionals and loops</h3></summary>
<p>Given a positive integer denoting n, do the following:</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd>If 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., one for 1, two for 2, etc.).</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd>If n ≥ 9 , print Greater than 9.</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary><h3>Problem 6: For loop in C</h3></summary>
<p>For each integer n in the interval [a,b] (given as input) :</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd> If 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., one for 1, two for 2, etc.).</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd> Else if n > 9 and it is an even number, then print "even"</p>
 <P><kbd>⇥</kbd> Else if n > 9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".</p>
